# Angularcli2template

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

## Prerequisites
- NodeJS vLatest: *https://nodejs.org/en/*
- angular cli installed globally: *npm install -g @angular/cli*
- Packages restored: *npm install*

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development Restful server Db.Json Demo 

Run `npm run startall` to start both a dev server on port 4200  and a dev local restful server on port 3050. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/actors`. This will redirect the request to a proxy server that is running and started on `http://localhost:3050` use proxy.conf.js to config the server fully. Actors returns a demo json file of actors who have appeared in starwars movies. I use `concurrently` to start both the demo restful server `json-server` and the webpack dev server as shown below :    

"startall": "concurrently \"npm run rest\" \"npm run web\""

"web": "ng server --proxy-config proxy.conf.js" 

"rest": "json-server db.json --port 3050"


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
